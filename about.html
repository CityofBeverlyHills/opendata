<p>The City of Beverly Hills Open Data initiative aims to make data created or collected by the City easily accessible to citizens,
  City departments, other government agencies, non-profits, and commercial interests.</p>
<br>
<h3>What data is on the portal?</h3>
<p>Data on the Open Data Portal is public data. Many of the datasets made available here were previously available as PDFs or on
a web page. Providing this data in its original tabular or geographic information system format makes it accessible for more purposes.
While the site is being built out, datasets will continue to be added.</p>
<br>
<h3>How do I use the portal?</h3>
<br>
<h4>Datasets</h4>
<p>The Datasets page is where you will find a searchable list of all datasets available on the Open Data Portal. You can go to this page
  by clicking "Datasets" on the top navigation bar or by clicking the start browsing button on the home page. To see the full information
  about a dataset, click on the dataset name.</p>
<br>
<h4>Categories</h4>
<p>From the homepage, click on a category tile for your area of interest. This will link you to a filtered view of datasets that are
  tagged with that category. You can also filter by category from the Datasets page by clicking the category name on the left.</p>
<br>
<h4>Searching</h4>
<p>From the datasets page, type a word or words describing the data you are looking for in the search box at the top of the list of datasets.
The search tool searches by dataset names, words from the description, and key words.</p>
<br>
<h4>Downloading</h4>
<p>On the page for a particular dataset, you will see a list of data types under Resources. Data of type "shp" (zipped shapefile) and "csv"
  (comma delimited table) are available for download. A type of "html" will link to a web page. Relevant information about the dataset can be found under the Additional Info heading.</p>
